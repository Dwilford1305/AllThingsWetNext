# Scraper Enhancement Summary - Data Cleanup & Source Expansion

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Old Event Data Cleanup** ✅
- **Problem**: Events from previous days (July 7) were still showing in the system
- **Solution**: Added automatic cleanup of past events in `comprehensiveScraperService.ts`
- **Implementation**: 
  - Automatically deletes events with dates before yesterday (end of previous day)
  - Runs on every scrape to ensure fresh data
  - Checks `startDate`, `date`, and `endDate` fields

### 2. **Old News Data Cleanup** ✅
- **Problem**: News articles from 4+ days ago were still showing
- **Solution**: Added automatic cleanup of old news articles (>30 days old)
- **Implementation**:
  - Automatically deletes news articles older than 30 days
  - Runs on every scrape to prevent stale content
  - Checks `publishedDate` and `createdAt` fields

const yesterday = new Date()
yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1)
await Event.deleteMany({
  $or: [
    { startDate: { $lt: yesterday } },
    { date: { $lt: yesterday } },
    { endDate: { $lt: yesterday } }
  ]
})
```

### News Cleanup
```typescript
// Removes news articles older than 30 days
const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date()
thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30)
await NewsArticle.deleteMany({
  $or: [
    { publishedDate: { $lt: thirtyDaysAgo } },
    { createdAt: { $lt: thirtyDaysAgo } }
