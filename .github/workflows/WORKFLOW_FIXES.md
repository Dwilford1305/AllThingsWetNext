# Copilot Setup Steps Workflow - Fix Documentation

## Summary
Fixed critical issues in the `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow file that were causing syntax errors and preventing proper execution.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Malformed Conditional Logic (Lines 125 and 139)

**Problem:**
```yaml
if [ "${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && inputs.allow_partial_failures == 'true') || (github.event_name != 'workflow_dispatch') && 'true' }}" = "true" ]; then
```

**Issues:**
- Missing logical operator between conditions
- Invalid bash conditional syntax: `|| ... && 'true'`
- The expression `(github.event_name != 'workflow_dispatch') && 'true'` is malformed
- This would cause bash syntax errors when the workflow runs on push/PR events

**Solution:**
```yaml
if [ "${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && inputs.allow_partial_failures == 'true' || github.event_name != 'workflow_dispatch' }}" = "true" ]; then
```

**Explanation:**
- Simplified the boolean logic
- Uses proper OR operator: `condition1 || condition2`
- Evaluates to:
  - `true` when workflow_dispatch is triggered with allow_partial_failures=true
  - `true` when triggered by push/PR (not workflow_dispatch)
  - `false` when workflow_dispatch is triggered with allow_partial_failures=false

### 2. Added Comments for Clarity

Added inline comments explaining the conditional logic:
```yaml
# Allow partial failures when: (1) workflow_dispatch with allow_partial_failures=true, OR (2) on push/PR
```

### 3. Improved Environment Configuration Step

**Before:**
```yaml
echo "MONGODB_URI not set - operating in graceful no-database mode."
```

**After:**
```yaml
echo "⚠️  MONGODB_URI not set - operating in graceful no-database mode."
echo "   Some tests may fail - this is expected behavior."
```

Added better visibility and clearer messaging about expected behavior.

### 4. Enhanced Dev Server Cleanup

**Before:**
```bash
kill $DEV_PID || true
wait $DEV_PID 2>/dev/null || true
```

**After:**
```bash
# Ensure cleanup on script exit
trap "kill $DEV_PID 2>/dev/null || true; wait $DEV_PID 2>/dev/null || true" EXIT
```

Uses bash `trap` to ensure the dev server is always stopped, even if the script exits unexpectedly.

## Testing

### Validated Changes:
1. ✅ YAML syntax validation passed
2. ✅ Workflow structure validated
3. ✅ All steps properly configured
4. ✅ Conditional logic tested with simulations
5. ✅ Environment variable handling verified

### Test Scenarios Covered:
- **Scenario 1:** Workflow dispatch with allow_partial_failures=true → Allows failures
- **Scenario 2:** Workflow dispatch with allow_partial_failures=false → Fails on errors
- **Scenario 3:** Push/PR trigger → Allows failures (graceful mode)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### On Push/Pull Request:
- Tests will run and allow partial failures
- Lint will run and allow partial failures
- Build must succeed
- Validation will run if endpoints are accessible

### On Manual Workflow Dispatch:
- User can choose to run tests (default: true)
- User can choose to run lint (default: true)
- User can choose to perform validation (default: true)
- User can control whether to allow partial failures (default: true)

### Graceful Degradation:
- Workflow operates correctly without MongoDB connection
- Failed tests are logged but don't fail the workflow (when partial failures allowed)
- Lint errors are logged but don't fail the workflow (when partial failures allowed)

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` - Fixed conditional logic and improved error handling

## Deployment
These changes take effect immediately upon merge to main branch. The workflow will:
1. Run automatically on push to main
2. Run automatically on pull requests to main
3. Be available for manual triggering via workflow_dispatch

## Verification Steps

To verify the workflow is working correctly:

1. **Check Workflow Syntax:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml'))"
   ```

2. **View Workflow in GitHub Actions:**
   - Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
   - Look for "All Things Wetaskiwin Setup" workflow
   - Manually trigger with different input combinations

3. **Monitor Workflow Runs:**
   - Check that tests complete successfully
   - Verify partial failures are handled gracefully
   - Confirm dev server validation works

## Additional Notes

- The workflow timeout is 25 minutes total
- Node.js 20.x is required
- Environment variables are injected from repository secrets
- Build artifacts (dev.log) are preserved for debugging
