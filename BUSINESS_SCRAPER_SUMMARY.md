# Wetaskiwin Business Scraper - Final Implementation Summary

## Task Completed ✅

Successfully rewrote and improved the Wetaskiwin business scraper to correctly parse business names, addresses, and contact details from the city business directory.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Simplified Scraping Logic
