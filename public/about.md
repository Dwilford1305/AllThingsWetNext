# About All Things Wetaskiwin

## Bringing Our Community Together

All Things Wetaskiwin is all about making life easier for everyone in our community. Instead of checking multiple websites, social media pages, and bulletin boards to find out what's happening in town, you can come here to find everything in one place.

Whether you're looking for local events, checking out businesses in town, hunting for a job, or wanting to sell something, we've got you covered.

## Our Mission

We're working to bring all of Wetaskiwin's information and resources together on one website so that:

- You can easily find local events and activities
- You can discover and support our amazing local businesses
- You can find job opportunities right here in town
- You can stay up-to-date with local news
- You can buy, sell, and trade with your neighbors

Our goal is simple: make it easier for our community to stay connected and informed.

## Meet the Developer

Hi there! I'm **Derek Wilford**, and I'm the person behind All Things Wetaskiwin. This is actually my first big project, and I'm pretty excited about it!

I've always loved Wetaskiwin and wanted to do something to help our community. After working in the tech world for a while, I decided to take the leap and try to build something that could really make a difference for people here.

You can learn more about me and my work at [derekwilford.ca](https://derekwilford.ca).

## Building a Business with AI Help

Here's something pretty cool - I'm building this entire website with help from artificial intelligence! I use AI tools to help me write code, solve problems, and figure out how to build new features. It's like having a really smart coding buddy who's available 24/7.

This is part of my bigger plan to build a profitable business that serves our community. I believe that with the help of AI, one person can now do what used to take a whole team of developers. It's pretty amazing what's possible these days!

By using AI assistance, I can focus more on what matters most - making sure this website is useful for everyone in Wetaskiwin.

## A Work in Progress

I want to be honest with you - this website is still growing and improving. I'm constantly adding new features, fixing things that aren't quite right, and trying to make it better based on what people tell me they need.

If you have ideas, find something that's not working, or just want to chat about the project, I'd love to hear from you!

## How You Can Help

The best way to help is simple: use the website! The more people who find events, support local businesses, and share information here, the more valuable it becomes for everyone.

You can also:
- Tell your friends and neighbors about the site
- Let me know if you find any problems
- Suggest new features or improvements
- Share your local events and news
