### Development Workflow Integration

#### Local Development Scripts
```bash
npm run test:e2e              # Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui           # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:headed       # Visible browser mode
npm run test:e2e:debug        # Step-by-step debugging
npm run test:e2e:chromium     # Chromium only
npm run test:e2e:firefox      # Firefox only
npm run test:e2e:webkit       # WebKit only
npm run test:e2e:mobile       # Mobile devices only
npm run test:all              # Unit + E2E tests
```

#### CI/CD Automation
- **Trigger Events**: Push to main/develop, PRs, manual dispatch
- **Matrix Strategy**: Parallel execution across browser types
- **Artifact Management**: 30-day retention of test results
- **Failure Handling**: Screenshot capture and detailed reporting

### Database and Environment Support

#### Development Environment

## Impact

This implementation transforms the testing landscape for AllThingsWetNext:

**Before**: No end-to-end testing, critical gap in test coverage
**After**: Comprehensive 225-test E2E suite covering all critical user workflows

The framework provides confidence in application functionality across browsers and devices, ensures user workflows work correctly end-to-end, and establishes a solid foundation for continuous quality assurance as the application evolves.
