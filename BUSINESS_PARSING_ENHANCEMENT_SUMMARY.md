# Business Name Parsing and Website Linking Enhancement Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Website URL Extraction Missing
**Problem:** The business scraper was removing website URLs from scraped text but not capturing them for storage.

**Solution:** Added `extractWebsite()` method that extracts website URLs before text cleaning:
- Supports various formats: `Link: www.example.com`, `Link: https://example.com`, standalone URLs
- Automatically adds `https://` protocol if missing
- Extracts URLs before they are removed by cleaning logic

**Example improvements:**
- Before: No website captured for any business
- After: Properly extracts `https://www.abcauto.com` from "ABC Auto Link: www.abcauto.com"

### 2. Business Name Parsing Improvements
**Problem:** Complex business names were incorrectly parsed, especially when contact names were concatenated or when business names contained multiple business endings.

**Solution:** Enhanced `parseNameAndContactSimplified()` method with:
- Better handling of concatenated words (e.g., "ServiceGary Johnson" → "Service Gary Johnson")
- Improved business ending detection that prevents business endings from being treated as contact names
- Smarter contact name extraction that checks if potential contacts are actually business words

**Example improvements:**
- Before: "Johnson's Auto ServiceGary Johnson" → Name: "Johnson's Auto", Contact: "ServiceGary Johnson"
- After: "Johnson's Auto ServiceGary Johnson" → Name: "Johnson's Auto Service", Contact: "Gary Johnson"
- Before: "Quality Auto Service" → Name: "Quality Auto", Contact: "Service" 
- After: "Quality Auto Service" → Name: "Quality Auto Service", Contact: ""

### 3. Enhanced Logic Flow
**Improvements made:**
1. **Website extraction first:** URLs are captured before text cleaning removes them
2. **Concatenation fixing:** Spaces are inserted between business endings and contact names
3. **Business ending priority:** If text ends with business endings, keep whole text as business name
4. **Smart contact detection:** Only extract contacts that aren't business words themselves
5. **Fallback logic:** Improved fallback parsing for edge cases

## Code Changes Made

### In `wetaskiwinBusiness.ts`:
1. Added `extractWebsite()` private method
2. Modified `parseBusinessEntry()` to call website extraction first
3. Enhanced `parseNameAndContactSimplified()` with improved parsing logic
4. Updated return object to include website field

### Tests Added:
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/business-parsing.test.ts`
- 18 test cases covering all parsing scenarios
- Tests validate website extraction, name/contact separation, and edge cases

## Validation Results

### Test Results:
✅ All 18 tests pass
✅ Website extraction works for all formats
✅ Business name parsing correctly handles concatenated words
✅ Business endings not treated as contact names
✅ Contact names properly extracted when present

### Build Results:
✅ Application builds successfully without errors
✅ All existing tests continue to pass (18/18)
✅ ESLint passes with no warnings or errors

### UI Integration:
✅ Business directory UI already supports website buttons (confirmed in `/businesses/page.tsx` lines 378-384)
✅ Website URLs will now be populated from scraper data
✅ "Website" button will appear for businesses with website data

## Expected User Impact

1. **Better Business Names**: Businesses will have accurate, clean names without contact person names incorrectly included
2. **Website Buttons**: All businesses with websites will now show a functional "Website" button linking to their site
3. **Improved Data Quality**: Cleaner separation between business information and contact person information
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can easily visit business websites directly from the directory

## Next Steps

When the scraper runs next, it will:
1. Extract website URLs that were previously being discarded
2. Provide cleaner business names with better parsing
3. Populate the website field in the database
4. Enable website buttons to appear in the UI for businesses that have websites

The UI is already prepared to handle website data, so these improvements will take effect immediately once new data is scraped.
