# Combined Cron Job Architecture

## Overview

To stay within Vercel's Hobby plan limitations (2 cron jobs), the email processing functionality has been combined with the existing scraping cron jobs. This architecture maintains all email functionality while respecting plan constraints.

## Current Architecture

### Vercel Hobby Plan Configuration (vercel.json)
```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/api/cron/scrape?type=news", "schedule": "0 12 * * *" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/scrape?type=events", "schedule": "0 12 * * *" }
  ]
}
```

### Combined Functionality

**Daily at 6 AM Mountain Time (12 PM UTC):**
1. **News Scraping** - Collects local news articles
2. **Events Scraping** - Gathers community events  
3. **Email Queue Processing** - Sends marketing emails, newsletters, event digests
4. **Email Automation** - Processes automated campaigns and re-engagement flows

## Email Sending Strategy

### Immediate (Real-time)
These emails bypass the queue and send instantly:
- **Authentication**: Email verification, password reset, 2FA setup
- **Security Alerts**: Account security notifications
- **Business Critical**: Business request confirmations (configurable)
- **System Notifications**: Critical system alerts

### Queued (Daily Processing)
These emails are queued and processed during the daily cron:
- **Marketing Emails**: Newsletters, promotional content
- **Event Notifications**: Weekly event digests, event reminders  
- **Business Updates**: Non-critical business notifications
- **Re-engagement**: Automated campaigns for inactive users
- **Subscription Notifications**: Plan updates, billing reminders

## Technical Implementation

### Combined Cron Job (`/api/cron/scrape/route.ts`)
The scrape endpoint now includes email processing:

```typescript
// After scraping completion
console.log('ðŸ“§ Processing email queue...')
try {
  await ComprehensiveEmailService.processQueue(20) // Process up to 20 emails
  await EmailAutomationService.processAutomatedCampaigns()
  
  results.emailProcessing = {
    processed: 20,
    errors: []
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Error handling...
}
```

### Standalone Email Cron (`/api/cron/email/route.ts`)
This endpoint remains available for:
- **Pro Plan Users**: Who want separate email processing
- **Manual Processing**: Admin-triggered email queue processing
- **Development Testing**: Email functionality testing

## Benefits

### Cost Efficiency
- Stays within Hobby plan limits (saves $20/month)
- Maintains full email functionality
- No compromise on features

### Performance
- Efficient batch processing during low-traffic hours
- Combined database connections reduce overhead
- Single cron execution reduces cold start overhead

### Reliability
- All critical emails still send immediately
- Marketing emails sent consistently
- Full error tracking and retry logic maintained

## User Experience

### What Users Experience
- **Instant Critical Emails**: Authentication and security emails arrive immediately
- **Daily Marketing Digest**: Non-critical emails arrive once daily
- **Full Control**: Complete email preference management
- **Consistent Delivery**: Reliable email delivery with retry logic

### Email Timing Examples
- **Sign up at 2 PM**: Email verification sent immediately
- **Subscribe to newsletter at 3 PM**: Welcome email queued, sent next day at 6 AM
- **Password reset at 9 PM**: Reset email sent immediately
- **New event posted**: Event notification queued, sent next day at 6 AM

## Migration Path to Pro Plan

If upgrading to Pro plan in the future:

1. **Add separate email cron to vercel.json**:
   ```json
   { "path": "/api/cron/email", "schedule": "0 */2 * * *" }
   ```

2. **Remove email processing from scrape cron** (optional)

3. **Configure different schedules**:
   - Scraping: Daily at 6 AM
   - Email processing: Every 2 hours

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
- `CRON_SECRET`: Security token for cron authentication
- `EMAIL_BATCH_SIZE`: Number of emails to process per batch (default: 20)
- `EMAIL_PROCESSING_ENABLED`: Enable/disable email processing in combined cron

### Email Priorities
The system respects email priorities even in combined processing:
- `urgent`: Processed first
- `high`: Higher priority in queue
- `normal`: Standard processing
- `low`: Processed last

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Cron Job Results
The combined cron returns comprehensive results:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "news": { "new": 5, "updated": 2, "errors": [] },
    "events": { "new": 8, "updated": 1, "errors": [] },
    "emailProcessing": { "processed": 15, "errors": [] }
  },
  "duration": 12500,
  "message": "Combined scraping and email processing completed"
}
```

### Email Analytics
Full email analytics remain available:
- Open rates and click tracking
- Delivery status monitoring  
- Campaign performance metrics
- User engagement analytics

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Test Locally**: Use `/api/cron/email` GET endpoint for development testing
2. **Monitor Results**: Check cron job results for email processing status
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling for both scraping and email failures
4. **Batch Sizing**: Adjust email batch size based on usage patterns

### For Administrators  
1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check daily cron job results
2. **Queue Management**: Monitor email queue for processing delays
3. **Performance Tracking**: Review email delivery metrics
4. **User Feedback**: Monitor user reports of delayed notifications

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Smart Scheduling**: Time-based email priority adjustment
2. **User Timezone Optimization**: Send emails at optimal user times
3. **Enhanced Analytics**: More detailed email performance metrics
4. **Push Notification Integration**: Complement email with real-time notifications

### Scaling Considerations
1. **Batch Size Optimization**: Increase batch size as user base grows
2. **Processing Frequency**: Move to Pro plan for more frequent processing
3. **Service Isolation**: Separate services as infrastructure grows
4. **Queue Optimization**: Implement more sophisticated queue management

This combined architecture provides a robust, cost-effective solution that maintains full email functionality while respecting Vercel Hobby plan constraints.
