# Test Business Provisioning Fix

## Issue Fixed
The test business was not being provisioned or assigned to the super admin due to a null/undefined `businessIds` array check.

## Root Cause
In both `/api/admin/setup-test-business` and `/api/seed`, the code was checking:
```typescript
if (!superAdmin.businessIds.includes(TEST_BUSINESS_ID))
```

When `superAdmin.businessIds` was `undefined` or `null`, this would cause an error or fail silently.

## Fix Applied
Changed the check to safely handle undefined/null values:
```typescript
const businessIds = superAdmin.businessIds || []
if (!businessIds.includes(TEST_BUSINESS_ID))
```

## Testing the Fix

### With MongoDB Connection:

1. **Check test business setup status:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/setup-test-business
   ```

2. **Provision test business (requires setup key):**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/setup-test-business \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"setupPassword": "YOUR_SETUP_KEY"}'
   ```

3. **Run database seed (includes test business provisioning):**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed
   ```

4. **Check user businesses (as super admin):**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer SUPER_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/user/businesses
   ```

### Expected Results:
- Test business should be created with `id: 'test-platinum-business-admin'`
- Test business should be assigned to super admin (`claimedBy` and `claimedByUserId` set)
- Super admin's `businessIds` array should include the test business ID
- User businesses API should return the test business for the super admin
- Console logs should show successful linking messages

### Console Log Output:
```
🏢 Created new test business for super admin: wilfordderek@gmail.com
📋 Super admin current businessIds: []
🔗 Linked test business to super admin account
```
or
```
✅ Updated existing test business for super admin: wilfordderek@gmail.com
📋 Super admin current businessIds: [test-platinum-business-admin]
✅ Test business already linked to super admin account
```
